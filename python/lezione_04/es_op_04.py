'''Text Analysis:

     Create a function that takes a paragraph and counts the number of occurrences of each word.
    The function should print a report showing the most frequent words and their number of occurrences.
    You can use a for loop to iterate over the words in the text and a dictionary to store the occurrences.
    Implement error handling to handle missing files or other input issues.
